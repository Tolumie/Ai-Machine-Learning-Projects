    "# **Executive Report: Unsupervised Learning Analysis on S&P 500 Stocks**  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Prepared for:** Senior Leadership Team  \n",
    "## **Prepared by:** Ogunbodede Tolulope Israel  \n",
    "## **Date:** [15/03/2024]  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Executive Summary**  \n",
    "This report presents an analysis of **S&P 500 stocks** using **unsupervised learning techniques**, specifically **clustering and dimensionality reduction**. The objective is to uncover patterns in stock behavior, identify natural groupings, and detect potential outliers that may impact investment decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key findings indicate that **three distinct stock clusters** were identified, with **Tesla, Nvidia, and Netflix classified as high-risk outliers**. The **DBSCAN algorithm** proved most effective in detecting these anomalies. The analysis leverages **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and various clustering techniques to segment stocks based on volatility, returns, and fundamental indicators.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Objective of the Analysis**  \n",
    "The primary goal of this study is to use **unsupervised learning models** to:  \n",
    "- Identify natural stock groupings based on financial and market behavior.  \n",
    "- Detect high-risk stocks that may require different investment strategies.  \n",
    "- Leverage **PCA and clustering models** to visualize and analyze market patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Data Overview**  \n",
    "The dataset consists of **historical stock data (2021â€“2024)** retrieved from **Yahoo Finance**, focusing on **10 major S&P 500 companies**. Key attributes include:  \n",
    "- **Stock prices:** Adjusted closing price data.  \n",
    "- **Market volatility:** Computed using a 30-day rolling standard deviation.  \n",
    "- **Fundamental indicators:** Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Dividend Yield, and Market Capitalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Methodology**  \n",
    "### **4.1 Data Preparation**  \n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Computed daily returns and volatility.  \n",
    "- **Missing Value Handling:** Applied sector-based median imputation.  \n",
    "- **Data Scaling:** Used **MinMaxScaler** for consistent clustering performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Dimensionality Reduction using PCA**  \n",
    "- **PCA was applied** to reduce dimensionality from five features to two principal components, retaining **70.5 percent of variance**.  \n",
    "- **Visualizations used:**  \n",
    "  - **PCA Scree Plot** to justify dimensionality reduction.  \n",
    "  - **PCA Scatter Plot** to visualize stock distributions before clustering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Clustering Techniques Evaluated**  \n",
    "#### **K-Means Clustering**  \n",
    "- **Elbow Method Plot:** Identified the optimal number of clusters as three.  \n",
    "- **Silhouette Score Plot:** Verified the effectiveness of clustering separation.  \n",
    "- **PCA Projection Plot:** Provided a 2D visual representation of stock groupings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hierarchical Clustering**  \n",
    "- **Dendrogram Plot:** Used to determine the best cluster separation, confirming three optimal clusters.  \n",
    "- **Cluster Heatmap:** Illustrated stock relationships under different distance metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**  \n",
    "- **k-Distance Plot:** Determined the optimal parameter settings (`eps=0.8`).  \n",
    "- **DBSCAN PCA Scatter Plot:** Successfully detected **outliers**, unlike K-Means, which forced all stocks into a cluster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Key Findings and Insights**  \n",
    "Three distinct stock clusters were identified:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cluster 0 - Stable Stocks:** JPMorgan, ExxonMobil (Low volatility, steady returns).  \n",
    "- **Cluster 1 - Tech Growth Stocks:** Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft (High correlation in price movements).  \n",
    "- **Outliers - High-Risk Stocks:** Tesla, Netflix, Nvidia (Unpredictable price swings, high risk-reward potential).  \n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN emerged as the **most effective model**, successfully identifying **high-risk stocks** that exhibited unique market behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Limitations and Future Considerations**  \n",
    "- **Limitations:**  \n",
    "  - DBSCAN's results vary depending on parameter tuning.  \n",
    "  - Market conditions could influence clustering results over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Future Steps:**  \n",
    "  - Incorporate **macroeconomic indicators** such as interest rates and inflation.  \n",
    "  - Apply **supervised learning** to predict future cluster assignments.  \n",
    "  - Explore **time-series clustering** to analyze stock behavior over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Conclusion**  \n",
    "This analysis has revealed **hidden stock groupings** that can enhance investment decision-making. **Visualizations played a crucial role** in guiding model selection and providing actionable insights. Further refinements in clustering methodologies and additional data integration will support **real-time trading applications**."
